      <h4>What is climate change</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to an overall increase in Earth's average temperature.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. It happens when certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, like a blanket. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Greenhouse Effect</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. It happens when certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, like a blanket. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it.

However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have intensified this effect, leading to climate change.  When human activities release excessive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it enhances this natural process. As a result, more heat is trapped, leading to an increase in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and other impacts associated with climate change. These changes can have significant and far-reaching effects on ecosystems, economies, and human societies worldwide.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Causes</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Generating power - Most of the emissions in the world are caused by burning fossil fuels to provide heat and power.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Manufacturing goods - Emissions from manufacturing and industry are mostly caused by the burning of fossil fuels. One of the major global contributors to greenhouse gas emissions is the manufacturing industry.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Cutting down forests - When trees are cut down, the carbon they have been storing is released, which results in emissions.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Using transportation- Fossil fuels power the majority of automobiles, trucks, ships, and aircraft. Consequently, transportation has a significant role in the release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide.
</p> 
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Consuming too much - Greenhouse gas emissions are influenced by a number of factors, including your housing and power usage, mobility, food intake, and amount of waste disposed of.
